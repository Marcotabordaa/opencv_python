# Real-Time Object Recognition with OpenCV, TensorFlow & Keras

This project demonstrates real-time **object and face recognition** using **Python**, **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**. It was originally developed for an interactive workshop focused on introducing participants to the fundamentals of computer vision and AI.

##  What It Does

- Captures live video from your webcam
- Detects and tracks faces or objects in real-time
- Classifies images using a pre-trained neural network model
- Provides visual feedback (bounding boxes, labels, probabilities)

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV** – for real-time image processing
- **TensorFlow & Keras** – for deep learning models
- **Pre-trained CNNs** (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet) – for image classification
